Slider Puzzle with python and kivy
Works on Android with buildozer

My goal was to create a game whith Python and Kivy. I chose Kivy because of Android and Windows functionality.

With buildozer it is even possible to create a playable Android apk.

So that's it: my second python game.

As you can see, there is some room for improvement:

    game mode (easy, medium, hard)
    different color scheme (color weakness or color blindness)
